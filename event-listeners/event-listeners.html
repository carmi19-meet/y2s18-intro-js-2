In event-listeners.js, create an array called pictures of the file names of the images that you downloaded. One of the elements in the array should be './imgs/dog.jpg'.
Attach a click event listener to the image you created in step 2. The event listener should call the showNextPicture function.
Finish the showNextPicture function in event-listeners.js. Have the image change its src attribute when the image is clicked. The value of the src attribute should be based on currentIndex.
Raise your hand and get a checkoff from a TA or Instructor. Nice work!
